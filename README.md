A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science that consists of nodes connected by edges or links. In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. These children themselves can also be nodes, forming subtrees of the overall binary tree. Here are some key characteristics and concepts associated with binary trees:

Root: The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root. It serves as the starting point for traversing or accessing the tree.

Node: Each element or entity in a binary tree is called a node. A node contains data and references to its left and right children, if they exist.

Leaf Node: A leaf node is a node in the tree that has no children. In other words, it's a node with both its left and right child references set to null.

Internal Node: An internal node is a node in the tree that has at least one child, either on the left or the right.

Parent and Child Nodes: Nodes in a binary tree are organized hierarchically. A node may have child nodes (descendants), and the node above it in the hierarchy is called its parent.

Binary Search Tree (BST): A specific type of binary tree known as a binary search tree follows an ordering property. In a BST, for any given node:

All nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value.
All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
